# Compact progress

## Steps to take
1. Open and read contents of `thoughts/shared/progress/progress.md`
2. If the previous sections are explicitly marked as completed, you can remove them. If you are unsure about the status of a section, you must ask the user for context before proceeding.
3. Then, write everything we wrote so far to `thoughts/shared/progress/progress.md`, ensure to note the approach we are taking, the steps we've done so far, and the current issues we are working on right now.

Then respond to the user with the brief summary of the updates you did in the `progress.md` file, no more than 2 sentences.
